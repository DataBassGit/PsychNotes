# PsychNotes
Automatic Transcription and Summarization of Psychotherapy Telehealth Sessions

## Concept:
A system that first transcribes a full interview from a video recording with timestamps.
Then it logically segments the interview into individual subjects or segments.
Afterwards, it summarizes each segment for quick reference.
Finally, it catalogs by segment, allowing for statistical and sentiment analysis.

## Status: Ideation

## Purpose:
help mental health professionals review and analyze therapy sessions more efficiently. The ability to automatically transcribe, summarize, and categorize content could save time and allow for deeper analysis.

## Considerations:
Privacy: Using cloud or hosted speech to text systems and generative language models presents privacy concerns that will need to be addressed. Hosting local models or open source models on the cloud could work, however may be cost prohibitive. Strict access controls and encryption would be critical.
Bias: Testing of language models for accuracy and bias would need to be performed. This would also be cost prohibitive. Rigorous testing and evaluation of the models would be important to ensure accuracy and fairness. Ongoing monitoring may be needed.
Adoption: Mental health professionals must trust the system's capabilities. Starting with a minimum viable product focused on transcription and then layering on summarization and analysis features over time may help build confidence.
Customization: How customizable the segmenting and cataloging features could PsychNotes be to support different therapeutic approaches and client needs. Flexibility there could make the system more useful.
